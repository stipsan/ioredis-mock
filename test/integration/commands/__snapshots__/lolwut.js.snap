" TRYING   TO GRASP 
 THE BLINDING   GLOBE   OF FIRE 
 THEY ALL RETURN   TO   THEIR ROOTS 
 WHEN IT REACHES   THE STRATOSPHERE 
 THE HAIR   BETWEEN THE LIPS 
 IT EXPANDS   RAPIDLY 
 THEY LAY   MOTIONLESS   WITHOUT SPEAKING 
 ASSUMES   THE WELL-KNOWN SHAPE   OF A MUSHROOM 
 TILL HE MOVED   HIS FINGERS   SLOWLY 
 THE SUMMIT   OF THE CLOUD 

In 1961, Nanni Balestrini created one of the first computer-generated poems, TAPE MARK I, using an IBM 7090 mainframe. Each execution combined verses from three literary sources following algorithmic rules based on metrical compatibility and group constraints. This LOLWUT command reproduces Balestrini's original algorithm, generating new stanzas through the same computational poetry process described in Almanacco Letterario Bompiani, 1962.

Use: LOLWUT IT for the original Italian output."
